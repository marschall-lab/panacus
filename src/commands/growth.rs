At each m, a countable is counted in the average growth if the countable is contained in at least floor(m*quorum) paths. Example: A quorum of 0.9 requires a countable to be in 90% of paths for each subset size m. At m=10, it must appear in at least 9 paths. At m=100, it must appear in at least 90 paths. A quorum of 1 (100%) requires presence in all paths of the subset, corresponding to the core. Default: 0, a countable counts if it is present in any path at each growth point. Specify multiple quorum values with a comma-separated list (e.g., --quorum 0.5,0.9). Use --coverage to set static path thresholds in conjunction with variable quorum percentages (e.g., --coverage 5,10).")
